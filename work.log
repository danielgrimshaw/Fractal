05/11/2015:
	1) I programmed the common code of the fractal package and fixed the
	coloring of Mandelbrot.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finish Image.
	3) I found it surprising that I had to use different algorithms for
	coloring the Julia and Mandelbrot sets.

05/12/2015:
	1) I started work on Image.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finally finish Image.
	3) I found that I had added an extra space between main and its
	arguments in Mandelbrot and Julia.

05/14/2015:
	1) Worked on fixing compilation problems with OpenGL.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finally finish Image.
	3) You cannot cross compile from headless Linux to windows with
	openGL.

05/18/2015:
	1) Today I successfully compiled and ran an OpenGL window. Currently
	it is only capable of changing the entire background at once, but I
	am currently working on learning how to draw on the canvas itself.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to get the OpenGL context capable of
	drawing two dimensional shapes.
	3) OpenGL itself does not actually implement a windowing system. I
	had to use GLFW3 along with it. My code also does not actually know
	where any of the graphics related functions are at compile time.

05/20/2015:
	1) Today I finally got the output working in the window. I was
	supposed to have the algorithms completed for drawing the fractals,
	but that ended up being too much.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to implement the fractals as fragment
	shaders. I will need to look up exactly how fragment shaders work,
	but I think that it will work better with fragment shaders than with
	vertex shaders.
	3) It takes about fifty lines of code just to draw a flat shaded
	orange triangle.

5/21/2015:
	1) Today I wrote a class for shader programs. I will need to rewrite
	the current version of window.cpp to use this Shader class
	(partially complete already).
	2) Rewrite window.cpp and shaders to use the Shader class.
	3) After writing Shader, it only takes five lines to use any shader.
