	1) I programmed the common code of the fractal package and fixed the
	coloring of Mandelbrot.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finish Image.
	3) I found it surprising that I had to use different algorithms for
	coloring the Julia and Mandelbrot sets.

05/12/2015:
	1) I started work on Image.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finally finish Image.
	3) I found that I had added an extra space between main and its
	arguments in Mandelbrot and Julia.

05/14/2015:
	1) Worked on fixing compilation problems with OpenGL.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to finally finish Image.
	3) You cannot cross compile from headless Linux to windows with
	openGL.

05/18/2015:
	1) Today I successfully compiled and ran an OpenGL window. Currently
	it is only capable of changing the entire background at once, but I
	am currently working on learning how to draw on the canvas itself.
	2) Tomorrow I would like to get the OpenGL context capable of
	drawing two dimensional shapes.
	3) OpenGL itself does not actually implement a windowing system. I
	had to use GLFW3 along with it. My code also does not actually know
	where any of the graphics related functions are at compile time.
